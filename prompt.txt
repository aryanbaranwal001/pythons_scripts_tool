You are generating a Python script to be placed inside the "scripts/" folder of my mathRunner project. 
Follow these rules strictly:

1. The script file must be named exactly as the script's purpose (e.g., add.py, factorial.py).
2. The script must define:
   - INPUTS: a list of tuples (name: str, type: Python type) where type ∈ {int, float, str, bool}.
   - main(args): a function that receives arguments as a list of strings from input.txt.
3. Inside main():
   - Validate that the correct number of arguments are provided. 
   - Convert arguments to the correct type as specified in INPUTS.
   - Print the result clearly (no return, just print).
4. Error handling:
   - If arguments are missing or invalid, print a clear usage message (show expected arguments).
   - Handle ValueError or type conversion errors gracefully.
5. Do NOT import or depend on mathRunner.py — the script must be standalone and only rely on standard Python libraries unless explicitly told otherwise.

Example format:

```python
INPUTS = [("a", int), ("b", int)]

def main(args):
    if len(args) < 2:
        print("Usage: input.txt should have 2 numbers after 'add'")
        return
    try:
        a = int(args[0])
        b = int(args[1])
    except ValueError:
        print("Both arguments must be integers")
        return
    print(f"Sum of {a} and {b} = {a+b}")
